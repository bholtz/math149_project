===============

This project has the code we used for the computation of persistent homology of handwritten letterforms. Generate distances is the where the majority of the work is being done, where we compute the distances between each pair of letters in the Letters folder, then dump that in a CSV file. The python scripts then interpret the distances and attempt classification.
