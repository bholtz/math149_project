We did really well at predicting F and G
  F: only two-pronged letter in our test set
    there's also t, but that's...well, different
  G: could have been confused with C or e, but I guess the hook gave it away?

we only ever thought that one actually-uppercase letter was lower case
  (line 41 of results)
more often confused lowercase letters for uppercase, but even that's not terrible
  consider that C and c are indistinguishable but for size, o and O, u and U, etc.

generally we seem to perform worse on lowercase letters
best lowercase letter is c (confused only for C)
